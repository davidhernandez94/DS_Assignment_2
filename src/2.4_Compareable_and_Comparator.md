# 2.4 Comparable and Comparator

## 1. Sorting Collection of  Java-defined Class Data

When working with a collection of Java-defined class data, such as an `ArrayList<Integer>`, we often need to sort the elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).

Defining a Sorting Rule

To sort elements, we must first define a rule for comparing two objects—determining which is larger and which is smaller. Based on this comparison:
* Ascending order: Place the smaller element before the larger one.
* Descending order: Place the larger element before the smaller one.

We can use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the collection ascendingly. If we want the data to be sorted descendingly, we can use the `Collections.reverse()` method after.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(new Integer[]{1, 3, 4, 2}));

// sort the data ascendingly
Collections.sort(nums);			// 1, 2, 3, 4		

// revere the order of the data
Collections.reverse(nums);			// 4, 3, 2, 1
```

You can also use these methods to sort Strings, then the strings will be alphabetically sorted (also can be ascendingly and descendingly).

## 2. Sorting Collection of User-defined Class Objects

Previously, we saw how Java can easily sort an `ArrayList<Integer>` or an `ArrayList<String>` because the sorting rules for numbers and strings are well-defined. However, if we have an `ArrayList<Student>` where each `Student` has attributes like `id`, `fname`, `lname`, `age`, and `gender`, Java won’t know how to sort the list. Should the sorting be based on `fname`, `age`, or `gender`?

Since Java cannot automatically determine the sorting rule, a user-defined class is not Comparable by default. We must explicitly define a sorting rule for Java to sort objects of that class.

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> {       // implement the interface
    private String id;
    private String fname;
    private String lname;
    private int age;
    private char gender;

    // methods of the class 
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
    students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
}
```

There are two ways to solve this problem:
1. Using `Comparable` – If the data should always be sorted using one specific rule, implement the `Comparable` interface. For example, if students should always be sorted by `name`, we define a natural ordering based on that field.
2. Using `Comparator` – If the data needs to be sorted using multiple different rules, implement the `Comparator` interface. This allows sorting by `name` in one case, `age` in another, and `gender` in yet another, providing greater flexibility.

## 3. Comparable

If we need to define one specific rule to compare two `Student` objects, we can use the `Comparable` interface. This interface includes the abstract method `compareTo()`, which is used to define the sorting rule.

To achieve this, we make the Student class `implement Comparable<Student>` and override the `compareTo()` method inside the class.

How `compareTo()` Works

The `compareTo()` method behaves similarly to `equals()`, but instead of returning a boolean, it returns an integer:
* A positive value (`> 0`) means the current object (`this`) is greater than the compared object.
* A negative value (`< 0`) means the current object (`this`) is smaller than the compared object.
* A zero (`0`) means the two objects are equal in terms of sorting.

The exact magnitude of the returned integer does not matter, only its sign is important. For example, returning `4` or `999` both indicate that `this` is greater, while returning `-1` or `-100` means `this` is smaller.

Example: Sorting Students by `age`

If we want to compare students based on their age, we can represent the two students as `this.age` and `student.age`. Since `age` is an `int`, we can simply subtract them to determine the order:  

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.age - student.age;              // sort based on the age, ascending
//        return student.age - this.age;              // sort based on the age, descending
    }
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
    students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));
    students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));
    
    Collections.sort(students);
}
```

You can also modify the sorting rule. For example, if you want to sort students based on their `fname`, you need to update the `compareTo()` method accordingly.

In this case, we extract the two first names using `this.fname` and `student.fname`. However, since `fname` is a String, we cannot use subtraction (`-`) as we did with integers.

Fortunately, all Java-defined classes that have a natural ordering implement `Comparable` by default, including `String`, `Integer`, and `Double`. This means they already contain a built-in `compareTo()` method, which we can use directly to compare two values of these types.


```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname);   // sort based on the fname, ascending
    }
}
```

The data we have contains students with the same `fname`s :

```java
students.add(new Student("1", "yi", "wang", 36, 'm'));
students.add(new Student("2", "mike", "conna", 18, 'm'));
students.add(new Student("3", "jon", "a", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("4", "jon", "c", 22, 'f'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("5", "jon", "b", 22, 'f'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("6", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
students.add(new Student("-1", "jon", "d", 22, 'm'));			// same fname
```

When sorting a long list of data, it’s common for some elements to have the same value for a particular feature. If we only use `this.fname.compareTo(student.fname)`, elements with the same `fname` will be treated as equal (`compareTo()` returns `0`), and Java will not sort them further.

However, we may want to sort by `lname` as a secondary criterion when fnames are identical. In this case, we need to expand the sorting rule in the `compareTo()` method, i.e.: Weighted Comparison:

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname) * 100   // sort based on the fname ascending
            	+ this.lname.compareTo(student.lname) ;   // then lname ascending
    }
}
```

Here, multiplying `fname`’s comparison result by a large value (e.g., `1000`) ensures that differences in fname always dominate, while `lname` is only considered if fnames are equal.

This approach ensures a stable and meaningful ordering, first by `fname` and then by `lname` when needed.

This logic can be expanded further to compare additional attributes if needed. For example, if both `fname` and `lname` are equal, we can compare the `id` to ensure a fully ordered list.

```java
public class Student implements Comparable<Student> { 
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student student) {
        return this.fname.compareTo(student.fname) * 10000	    	 // sort based on the fname ascending
            	+ this.lname.compareTo(student.lname) * 100;    	 // then lname ascending
                 + this.id.compareTo(student.id) ;    				// then id ascending
    }
}
```

## Comparator

The `Comparable` interface is useful when you need a single, predefined sorting rule for a class. However, in many scenarios, multiple sorting criteria are required. For example, a teacher may want to sort students by `name` in some cases and by `score` in others. Similarly, an online shopping platform might allow customers to sort products by `date added` or `price`.

Since `Comparable` only supports one sorting method, it does not allow users to switch between different sorting rules dynamically. To solve this, we use the `Comparator` interface.

With `Comparator`, we can define multiple sorting strategies by creating separate comparator classes that implement the `Comparator` interface. This approach does not require modifying the original class (e.g., `Student`).

For instance, if we want to compare students based on their `age`s, we can create an `AgeComparator` class that implements `Comparator<Student>`. The `Comparator` interface provides the `compare()` method, which is similar to the `compareTo()` method in Comparable, except that it takes two objects as arguments instead of one.

```java
/**
 * A Comparator to compare two students based on their ages, then fname, then lname
 */
public static class AgeComparator implements Comparator<Student> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return (s1.age - s2.age) * 10000
            + s1.fname.compareTo(s2.fname)
            + s1.lname.compareTo(s2.lname);
    }
}
```

```java
/**
 * A Comparator to compare two students based on their gender, then fname,
 * then lname, then id
 */
public static class GenderComparator implements Comparator<Student> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        return (s1.gender - s2.gender) * 1000000
            + s1.fname.compareTo(s2.fname) * 10000
            + s1.lname.compareTo(s2.lname) * 100
            + s1.id.compareTo(s2.id);
    }
}
```

Now that we have created three separate comparator classes, each with a specific sorting rule, we can use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the data by passing the corresponding comparator as the second parameter.

```java
/**
 * Asks the user to choose a specific way to sort the students
 *
 * @param students the original students list
 */
public static void sortStudents(ArrayList<Student> students) {
    System.out.println("How do you want to sort the students");
    System.out.println("1. based on the age");
    System.out.println("2. based on the name");
    System.out.println("3. based on the gender");

    Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
    int choice = console.nextInt();

    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.AgeComparator());		// sort based on age
            return;
        case 2:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.NameComparator());		// sort based on name
            return;
        case 3:
            Collections.sort(students, new Student.GenderComparator());		// sort based on gender
            return;
    }
}
```

In practice, we can enhance the flexibility of comparators by embedding them within a class or even combining multiple comparators into a single one. This allows us to customize sorting behaviors based on different criteria in a more structured way.

1. Embedding Comparators inside a class:

We can define a comparator as an inner class inside the class we want to sort. This can help group the comparator with the class it’s related to, improving organization and readability.


``` java
public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    int score;

    public Student(String name, int age, int score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.score = score;
    }

    public static class AgeComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
            return Integer.compare(s1.age, s2.age);
        }
    }

    public static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
            return s1.name.compareTo(s2.name);
        }
    }

    public static class ScoreComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
            return Integer.compare(s1.score, s2.score);
        }
    }
}
```

Now, we can use these comparators just like before:

``` java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student("Alice", 22, 90));
students.add(new Student("Bob", 19, 85));
students.add(new Student("Charlie", 20, 88));

// Sorting by Age
Collections.sort(students, new Student.AgeComparator());

// Sorting by Name
Collections.sort(students, new Student.NameComparator());
```

2. Combining Multiple Comparators:

You can merge different comparators into one by adding a data member to a comparator that allows you to choose different sorting strategies. This is useful when you want to combine multiple criteria into a single comparator class.

Example:

``` java
public class MultiCriteriaComparator implements Comparator<Student> {
    private final String criteria;

    public MultiCriteriaComparator(String criteria) {
        this.criteria = criteria;
    }

    @Override
    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
        switch (criteria) {
            case "age":
                return Integer.compare(s1.age, s2.age);
            case "name":
                return s1.name.compareTo(s2.name);
            case "score":
                return Integer.compare(s1.score, s2.score);
            default:
                return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

Now, you can use this comparator to sort by any criteria dynamically:

``` java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student("Alice", 22, 90));
students.add(new Student("Bob", 19, 85));
students.add(new Student("Charlie", 20, 88));

// Sorting by Age
Collections.sort(students, new MultiCriteriaComparator("age"));

// Sorting by Name
Collections.sort(students, new MultiCriteriaComparator("name"));
```

In this way, you can avoid having multiple individual comparators and instead use a flexible comparator that adjusts based on a specified rule.
